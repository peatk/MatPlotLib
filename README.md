# Pymaceuticals, Inc. Analysis

## Background

Pymaceuticals, a company specializing in anti-cancer medications, hired me to analyze and complete their most recent animal study. The study reviews 249 mice with SCC tumors and the use of new drugs used to reduce the tumors. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose is to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
The executive team has tasked me with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked for a top-level summary of the study results.
